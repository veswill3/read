Speed Reading with "read"

Click in the box and paste any text you want to speed read. As soon as you click outside the box the top bar will begin. Relax your eyes and try not to sound out the words in your head. Instead, let them carry you along.

When you think you're ready to increase your speed, enter a new number in the box on the left. By default this page starts at 300 words per minute. That's already faster than the average person's reading speed. Congratulations.

Try increasing to 400 or 500wpm at first until you're comfortable. There's no special training involved, just a little practice. You'll quickly find that you can work your way up to 800 or even 1000wpm.

If you need to pause for a moment, just click on the text above. When you're ready to resume, click again and we'll ease you back up to speed.

Have fun!
